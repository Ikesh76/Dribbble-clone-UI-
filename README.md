Dribbble Landing Page UI Clone
Project Overview
This project is a personal endeavor to recreate the user interface (UI) of the Dribbble landing page. My main goal with this project was to get hands-on experience with HTML and CSS, particularly focusing on building responsive layouts using Flexbox. As a beginner in web development, this was a fantastic challenge to translate a beautiful existing design into clean, structured code.

Features

Pixel-Perfect (as much as possible for a beginner!): I tried my best to match the layout and visual elements of the original Dribbble landing page.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to look good on various screen sizes, from large desktops down to mobile devices, thanks to the power of Flexbox and media queries.
Clean HTML Structure: Focused on semantic HTML to ensure a well-organized and accessible document.
Modern CSS Styling: Utilized modern CSS techniques to achieve the visual aesthetics.


Technologies Used


HTML5: For structuring the content of the webpage.
CSS3: For all the styling, with a heavy emphasis on:
Flexbox: This was the star of the show for me! I used Flexbox extensively for creating flexible and dynamic rows and columns, aligning items, and distributing space within containers.
Media Queries: To make the layout adapt for different screen widths.
